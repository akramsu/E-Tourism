# Attraction Owner Onboarding Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a multi-step onboarding flow for attraction owners that guides them through creating their first attraction after registration, providing a smooth experience for new business users.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Auth Context (`client/contexts/auth-context.tsx`)

#### **New Interface Properties:**
```typescript
interface AuthContextType {
  // ... existing properties
  needsAttractionCreation: boolean
  markAttractionCreated: () => void
}
```

#### **New State Management:**
- `needsAttractionCreation` - Tracks if new owners need to create their first attraction
- `markAttractionCreated()` - Function to mark attraction creation as complete

#### **Registration Flow Enhancement:**
```typescript
// In register function
if (role === 'OWNER') {
  setNeedsAttractionCreation(true)
}
```

When attraction owners register, they are automatically flagged to create their attraction.

### 2. Updated Main App Flow (`client/tourease-app.tsx`)

#### **Multi-Step Onboarding Logic:**
```typescript
if (currentPage === "dashboard" && user) {
  // Step 1: Profile completion for new users
  if (needsProfileCompletion) {
    return <CompleteProfile onComplete={handleProfileComplete} />
  }

  // Step 2: Attraction creation for new owners
  if (needsAttractionCreation && user.role.roleName === "OWNER") {
    return (
      <div className="onboarding-container">
        <h1>Welcome to TourEase! 🎉</h1>
        <p>Let's get started by adding your first attraction</p>
        <CreateAttraction onAttractionCreated={handleAttractionCreated} />
      </div>
    )
  }

  // Step 3: Regular dashboard experience
  // ... normal dashboard content
}
```

#### **Enhanced Navigation:**
- Added `useEffect` to automatically redirect users to dashboard after authentication
- Added `handleProfileComplete()` for profile completion flow
- Enhanced `handleAttractionCreated()` to mark attraction creation complete

### 3. Enhanced Owner Dashboard

#### **Added Create Attraction Option:**
```typescript
case "Create Attraction":
  return <CreateAttraction onAttractionCreated={handleAttractionCreated} />
```

Owners can now create additional attractions from their dashboard sidebar.

### 4. Updated Sidebar (`client/components/app-sidebar.tsx`)

#### **New Menu Item:**
```typescript
// Owner menu items
const baseItems = [
  { title: "Performance Overview", url: "#", icon: Home },
  { title: "Create Attraction", url: "#", icon: Plus }, // NEW
  { title: "Manage Attraction", url: "#", icon: Building2 },
  // ... other items
]
```

Added "Create Attraction" with Plus icon to the owner sidebar menu.

## User Experience Flow

### **For New Attraction Owners:**

1. **Registration** 📝
   - User signs up selecting "Attraction Owner" role
   - Account created successfully
   - `needsAttractionCreation` flag set to `true`
