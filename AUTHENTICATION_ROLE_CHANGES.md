# Authentication Role Logic Changes

## Overview
Modified the authentication system to properly handle role-based access where roles are fetched from the database and restrict Tourism Authority role self-registration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Sign-In Form (`client/components/auth/sign-in-form.tsx`)
**Problem**: The sign-in form had a role selector dropdown that was unnecessary since user roles should be determined from the database during login.

**Changes**:
- ✅ Removed role state variable and dropdown selection
- ✅ Removed unused Select component imports
- ✅ Simplified form to only require email and password
- ✅ Login function now fetches user role from database automatically

**Impact**: Users can no longer "choose" their role during sign-in. The role is now properly fetched from their account in the database.

### 2. Sign-Up Form (`client/components/auth/sign-up-form.tsx`)
**Problem**: Users could select "Tourism Authority" role during registration, which should only be assigned by system administrators.

**Changes**:
- ✅ Removed "Tourism Authority" option from role dropdown
- ✅ Updated role type to only allow "owner" | "tourist"
- ✅ Added explanatory text about authority accounts being admin-created only
- ✅ Updated registration logic to handle the restricted role types

**Impact**: New users can only register as Attraction Owners or Tourists. Tourism Authority accounts must be created by administrators.

### 3. Backend Validation (`server/src/controllers/authController.js`)
**Problem**: No server-side validation to prevent AUTHORITY role self-registration.

**Changes**:
- ✅ Added validation check to prevent AUTHORITY role registration
- ✅ Returns 403 Forbidden with descriptive message when AUTHORITY role is attempted
- ✅ Only allows OWNER and TOURIST roles for self-registration

**Impact**: Even if someone bypasses frontend validation, the backend will reject AUTHORITY role registration attempts.

## Database Schema Alignment

The system now properly aligns with the Prisma schema:

```prisma
enum RoleType {
  AUTHORITY  // Admin-created only
  OWNER     // Self-registration allowed
  TOURIST   // Self-registration allowed
}
```

## User Flow Changes

### Before:
1. **Sign-In**: User selects role + enters credentials → Login
2. **Sign-Up**: User selects any role including Authority → Registration

### After:
1. **Sign-In**: User enters credentials → Role fetched from database → Login
2. **Sign-Up**: User selects Owner or Tourist only → Registration

## Authority Account Creation

Since users can no longer self-register as Tourism Authorities, these accounts must be created through:

1. **Direct Database Creation**: Using admin scripts or database tools
2. **Admin Panel**: Future feature for system administrators
3. **Backend API**: Using admin-level endpoints (to be implemented)

## Files Modified

1. `client/components/auth/sign-in-form.tsx` - Removed role selection
2. `client/components/auth/sign-up-form.tsx` - Restricted role options
3. `server/src/controllers/authController.js` - Added backend validation
4. `AUTHENTICATION_ROLE_CHANGES.md` - This documentation

## Testing

- ✅ Sign-in form compiles without errors
- ✅ Sign-up form compiles without errors
- ✅ Backend validation prevents AUTHORITY role registration
- ✅ All existing role-based routing and permissions remain functional

## Security Improvements

1. **Role Integrity**: User roles are now authoritative from database
2. **Access Control**: Prevents unauthorized authority account creation
3. **Validation**: Both frontend and backend validation for role restrictions
4. **Audit Trail**: Clear separation between user-created and admin-created accounts

## Migration Notes

- **Existing Users**: No impact on existing users or their roles
- **Authority Users**: Existing authority users can still sign in normally
- **New Registrations**: Only Owner and Tourist roles available for self-registration
- **Database**: No schema changes required, only application logic changes
