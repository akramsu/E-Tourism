# Owner Reports Integration Summary

## Overview
The Owner Reports page (`pages/owner/reports.tsx`) has been fully refactored to use live data from the backend API, replacing all mock data with real functionality for report generation, management, and download.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Report Generation
- **Live Report Types**: Uses `ownerApi.getReportTypes()` to fetch available report types from backend
- **Dynamic Metrics**: Uses `ownerApi.getAvailableMetrics()` to get metrics specific to the attraction
- **Real Generation**: Uses `ownerApi.generateReport()` to create reports with user-specified parameters
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive validation before submission

### 2. Report Management
- **Report List**: Uses `ownerApi.getReports()` to fetch attraction-specific reports
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time status updates (pending, processing, completed, failed)
- **Download Functionality**: Uses `ownerApi.downloadReport()` for file downloads
- **Delete Reports**: Uses `ownerApi.deleteReport()` to remove unwanted reports

### 3. Enhanced UI/UX
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators for all async operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and retry functionality
- **Success Feedback**: Clear success notifications for all actions
- **Empty States**: Informative empty state when no reports exist

## API Integration

### Report Management API (`ownerApi`)
- `getReports(attractionId, params)` - Fetch attraction reports with filtering
- `generateReport(attractionId, config)` - Create new report
- `getReport(attractionId, reportId)` - Get specific report details
- `downloadReport(attractionId, reportId)` - Download report file
- `deleteReport(attractionId, reportId)` - Delete report
- `getReportTypes()` - Get available report types
- `getAvailableMetrics(attractionId)` - Get metrics available for the attraction

### Report Configuration
```typescript
interface ReportConfig {
  title: string
  description?: string
  reportType: string
  startDate: string
  endDate: string
  metrics: string[]
  exportFormat: 'pdf' | 'excel' | 'csv'
}
```

### Report Data Structure
```typescript
interface Report {
  id: number
  title: string
  description?: string
  reportType: string
  status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed'
  createdAt: string
  completedAt?: string
  downloadCount: number
  fileSize?: number
  errorMessage?: string
}
```
